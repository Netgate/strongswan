Package: netgate-strongswan
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: IPsec VPN solution.
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both, the IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package contains the IKEv1/IKEv2 keying daemon charon and command line
 configuration backend.

 It supports both, the IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package provides a libcharon plugin that can propagate IKE SA data into
 VPP. This can be used as an alternative to the other kernel plugins
 {netlink, pfkey, libipsec}.

 This package provides Trusted Network Connect's (TNC) architecture support.
 It includes support for TNC client and server (IF-TNCCS), IMC and IMV message
 exchange (IF-M), interface between IMC/IMV and TNC client/server (IF-IMC
 and IF-IMV). It also includes PTS based IMC/IMV for TPM based remote
 attestation, SWID IMC/IMV, and OS IMC/IMV. It's IMC/IMV dynamic libraries
 modules can be used by any third party TNC Client/Server implementation
 possessing a standard IF-IMC/IMV interface. In addition, it implements
 PT-TLS to support TNC over TLS.
