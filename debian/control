 This package provides extended authentication plugins for the charon library:
  - eap-mschapv2 (EAP-MSCHAPv2 protocol handler using passwords/NT hashes)
    Used for client side to connect to some VPN concentrators configured for
    Windows 7+ and modern OSX/iOS using IKEv2 (identify with public key,
    authenticate with MSCHAPv2).

    ipsec.secrets and other credential sets)
    Used for the client side to connect to VPN concentrators configured for
    Android and older OSX/iOS using IKEv1 and XAUTH (identify with public key,
    authenticate with XAUTH password).
 .
