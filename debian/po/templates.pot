"Restarting strongSwan is recommended, since if there is a security fix, it "
"will not be applied until the daemon restarts. Most people expect the daemon "
"to restart, so this is generally a good idea. However, this might take down "
"existing connections and then bring them back up, so if you are using such a "
"strongSwan tunnel to connect for this update, restarting is not recommended."

"An X.509 certificate for this host can be automatically created or imported. "
"It can be used to authenticate IPsec connections to other hosts and is the "
"preferred way of building up secure IPsec connections. The other possibility "
"would be to use shared secrets (passwords that are the same on both sides of "
"the tunnel) for authenticating a connection, but for a larger number of "
"connections, key based authentication is easier to administer and more "
"secure."
